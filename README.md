Interval :: Programming Test
=============

Final complexity of the main algorithm is O(n*log(n)).
The steps of big O calculation can be found in javadoc of "IntervalProcessor.process" method.

Description:
Make a program  that takes two inputs:
•   a set of include intervals
•   a set of exclude intervals

The sets of intervals can be given in any order, and they may be empty or overlapping
The program should output the result of taking all the includes and “remove” the excludes.
The output should be given as non-overlapping intervals in a sorted order.
Intervals will contain Integers only.
